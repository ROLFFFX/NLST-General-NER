 AP CHEST ,3:55 A.M., ON [**2-23**]

 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, question progression.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2-21**]:

 Relatively homogeneous dissemination of opacification through the right lung
 is more characteristic of edema than pneumonia, and has been a relatively
 constant feature since [**Name (NI) 791**], although a suggestion of nodulation might
 mean that this is a very widespread infection.  Left lower lung is densely
 consolidated, and while some of this could represent more edema, is strongly
 suggestive of pneumonia.  Small left pleural effusion has been present
 chronically.  Heart is at least moderately enlarged but partially obscured by
 the overlying right hemidiaphragm.  There is no pneumothorax.  ET tube is in
 standard placement.  Right supraclavicular central venous dual-channel
 catheter, presumably for dialysis, projects over the upper right atrium
 alongside a transvenous pacer wire.  A second wire passes to the floor of the
 right ventricle, both unchanged and continuous from the left axillary
 pacemaker.  Nasogastric tube passes at least as far as the stomach, but the
 tip is not distinct.  Left jugular line goes at least as far as the upper SVC,
 but the tip is obscured.  No pneumothorax.

communication to pacreatic duct s/p IR embolization, who
presented with 3 days intermittent dark hematemesis.
.
Regarding the patient's recent admission, after 6 episodes of
hematemesis, he underwent MRCP demonstrating a large GDA
pseudoaneurysm with mass effect on the pancreatic head, as well
as chronic pancreatitis. EGD on [**7-13**] showed 2 ulcers and
hemobilia from the major papilla. He subsequently underwent
successful IR guided embolization on [**7-15**]. Throughout his
admission he required 3 units PRBCs for ""autonomic instability.""
His Hct stabilized at 30 prior to discharge.
.
On admit, Mr. [**Known lastname **] c/o 3 episodes of hematemesis, the first
episode being 4 days PTA, and the last 2 episodes on the AM of
admission. Could not quantify amount. Also of note, he reports
""dark stool"" for the last 3-4 days. The first episode of
vomitting he describes as more coffee ground, with subsequent
episodes darker. He also noted lightheadedness.

was 29.1 on transfer. He was given 2L NS, as well as morphine
and ativan
.
MICU course:
Endoscopy was performed on admission which showed [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
tear without evidence of active bleeding. Repeat thrombin
injection via IR-guidance into pseudoaneurysm, without evidence
of active bleeding. Hct trended down to 19 after the procedure
from admission hct of 29, and patient transfused two units pRBC
with appropriate bump in hct to 27, and then up to 29 in 12
hours without further transfusion. Patient without further
episodes of hematemesis. He was continued on protonix IV bid,
and had a CTA performed to evaluate for presence of aneurysm,
which showed resolution. He is transferred to the floor for
further hct monitoring. Currently has no complaints. Denies
abdominal pain, fevers, chills, hematemesis, BRPBR, melena.

Brief Hospital Course:
*** Patient left AMA, although hematocrits were stable, no
follow up was arranged prior to his departure.

27 M with C5 quadripelegia, splenectomy, DVT s/p IVC filter, and
recent UGIB with PUD and a GDA pseudoaneurysm s/p IR
embolization admitted with 3 days dark hematemesis.
.
#. Hematemesis: The patient was kept NPO and started on an IV
PPI [**Hospital1 **]. An NGT was placed with dark red blood which cleared
with normal saline lavage. Patient had serial hcts q6 hour
initially with admit hct of 29, down to 19 after procedure,
which then responded appropriately to 2u pRBC. EGD showed a
well-healing [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear with stigmata of recent bleeding
in the cardia and gastroesophageal junction. This was thought to
have a low likelihood of rebleeding. CT of the abd/pelvis on
[**2128-8-2**] showed evidence of persistent GDA ANR which was treated
with repeat thrombin injection. CTA post-procedure showed
resolution of the aneurysm.
-Continue PPI [**Hospital1 **] - change to po BID.

.
#. Leukocytosis: Admission value of 22.3, but trending down
during hospital course. Has history of UTI and MRSA bacteremia
and UA suspicious for infection, with culture growing CNSA.
Received several doses of ciprofloxacin initially, but d/c'd in
setting of culture results. Given that HD stable, felt to be
colonizer, suprapubic cath changed. Also low grade temps over
the past few days.
.
#. Scrotal tear. Patient noted scrotal tear to RN, but unable to
examine currently because friends in room.  Treated with wound
care, dressing changes.
.
#. Chronic Pancreatitis: Diagnosed on prior imaging.  Has
significant EtOH history.  LFTs unremarkable. Pancreatic enzymes
slightly increased on admission, trended down throughout stay.
No pain secondary to quadraplegia.
.
#. Quadripelegia/Autonomic dysfunction: Has prior record of
diaphoresis and shaking chills due to autonomic instability,
without significant symptoms during this stay.
.
#. DVT s/p IVC filter: Occurred in [**2119**].  IVC filter currently
clotted off.  Not on anticoagulation given recent GIB.

Nutrition:  Ad lib po feeds, [**Month/Day (2) 1842**] 24 by concentration.  Feeds just increased today from 20 to 24 kcal/oz.  Average of past 3 day intake ~105 cc/kg/day.  Based on average intake, projected intake for next 24 hrs is ~84 kcal/kg/day and ~2.6 g pro/kg/day.
GI: Abdomen benign.  Occasional wet burps

A/Goals:
Tolerating feeds without GI problems except continued symptoms of reflux after feeds.  Infant was changed to [**Month/Day (2) 1842**] per GI recs to improve reflux.  [**Month/Day (2) 264**] not needed.  CUrrent feeds + supps meeting weaned recs for pro/vits and mins.  Infant receives vitamin supplementation for now, related to low volume intake.  If intake increases to ~130 to 150 cc/kg/day, Goldline baby vits can be d/c'd.  Not meeting weaned kcal recs of ~108 kcal/kg/day, which is also related to low volume intake.  Feedings could be further concentrated to increase kcal intake, but concern is also w/ total fluids volume.  Have increased concentration of feeds today, and will wait to see if infant can further increase volumes.  Growth is not meeting recs for wt gain of ~20 to 35 g/day.  Meeting recs for HC gain, and LN gain is exceeding recommended ~1 cm/wk. LN gain represents catch up growth.  WIll continue to follow w/ team and participate in nutrition plans.

 Reference exam, [**2111-10-31**].

 Compared to the film from prior day, there is worsening bilateral lower lobe
 fluffy alveolar infiltrates with pulmonary vascular redistribution.  The
 amount of effusion is also increased.  Cardiac silhouette can't be assessed
 due to the opacity of both lower lobes.  The findings are consistent with
 worsening chf with and without superimposed infection.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  72 yo woman c T2 DM, HTN, admitted c elevated BS up to
400, metabolic acidosis c hyperkalemia , renal failure, UTI  and
respiratory failure most likely  d/2 aspiration and heart
failure.
.
#Respiratory failure- Patient was intubated at OSH after
witnessed aspiration event after receiving kayexelate.  She
remained intubated after transfer initially and was slowly
weaned off the ventilator.  Once her metabolic status was
improved, she was extubated.  Post extubation she continued to
have high oxygen requirement with one or two episodes of
desaturation.  CXR was consistent with volume overload and she
was given lasix for diuresis.  She diuresed well with IV lasix
and her O2 requirement improved.  She was also treated with
levoflox for aspiration Pneumonia.
.
# Hyperkalemia - at OSH, patient was given Calcium gluconate,
bicarb.  Renal was consulted on transfer to ICU.  They
recommended IVF and lasix, along with calcium,
bacarbinate,insulin, glucose, albuterol and kayexalate.  Her
potassium steadily improved and by the following day she was
hypokalemic.  It was unclear why patient was hyperkalemic,  not
clearly medication related.  She had elevated blood sugars on
admission and acute renal insufficiency.
.
# Renal failure- Initially her renal function improved with
aggressive iv fluids and then tapered off.  She was diresed and
her renal function improved to 1.7 on day of discharge.  Prior
to discharge she was started on Losartan.  Her potassium and
renal function should be monitored closely.
.
#  CHF- Initially given concern for infection and elevated
lactate she received aggresive IV fluids.  After high O2
requirements post extubation she was given lasix for diuresis.
Her oxygen saturation improved drastically.  Echo was done which
showed EF 40-45%.  She was also restarted on her [**Last Name (un) **] and
hydral/imdur were added for afterload reduction.  Aspirin was
continued.  Her creatinine and potassium should be monitored
daily.
.
# UTI - Urine with GPC, She received a 7 day course of
Vancomycin.
.
# T2DM - Cont SSI.  She should be restarted on her PO diabetic
regimen after discharge.
# FEN - Patient received tube feeds while she was intubated.
Post extubation she underwent a Speech and Swallow evaluation
given her history of aspiration pneumonia.  Her swallow eval was
ok and her diet was advance to po diet.

 INDICATION:  Diastolic heart failure, chronic left effusion.

 COMPARISON:  [**2130-12-7**].

 A tracheostomy tube and left IJ catheter are unchanged in position.  There is
 a linear radiopaque density overlying the right upper arm and chest, which may
 correspond to a right-sided PICC line described in the prior study.  The tip
 of this right-sided PICC line may terminate in the right innominate vein.  The
 patient is post-sternotomy and presumed aortic valve replacement.  Despite
 patient rotation and the obliquity of the projection, there is opacification
 of the left hemithorax consistent with large left effusion.  Due to the
 projection, the cardiac silhouette is not adequately evaluated.  The right
 lung is relatively well aerated.

 IMPRESSION:
 1) Large left effusion.
 2) Linear opacity overlying the upper right arm and right chest.  If this
 opacity corresponds to the patient's previously described PICC line, the tip
 appears to be within the right innominate vein.

Technical Quality: Suboptimal


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

pt refused complete exam. Suboptimal apicals and subcostals.
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal interatrial septum. No
ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (?#). Cannot exclude AS.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. No TS. Mild [1+]
TR. Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PS.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

Conclusions:
Suboptimal image quality. The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). The study is inadequate
to exclude significant aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

 INDICATIONS:  A 24-year-old man with stab wound and question of a transection
 at T3.

 COMPARISONS:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT images of the thoracic spine were obtained, and sagittal
 and coronal reconstructions were also performed.

 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of a fracture, dislocation or bony
 destruction.  Small amounts of gas are seen near T5-T6, with one bubble
 within the spinal canal. This region also shows air in the subcutaneous
 overlying soft tissues of the back. The largest concentration of gas extends
 from around T5 through T6.

 Although CT is not able to resolve intrathecal detail, no gross hematoma is
 seen. The presence of an expansile hematoma or edema cannot be excluded by
 this study, however.

 The lung windows demonstrate large pneumothorax with pleural effusions. Please
 see the report of the chest CT of the same day for further details.

 IMPRESSION: Soft tissue gas as described consistent with stab wound. No
 evidence of metallic foreign body or fracture. Cord compression cannot be
 excluded by this study.

   Microbiology: Sputum is MRSA.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 76 year old female with a history of COPD on home oxygen (2L
   baseline), mild aortic stenosis and diastolic heart failure who
   presented to [**Location (un) 1415**] on [**2119-12-30**] with progressive dyspnea on exertion
   and cough productive of clear sputum transferred here after PEA arrest
   with evidence of unstable T11 fracture. Cord injury very likely, very
   poor surgical candidate. After discussing with family, will hold on any
   surgical intervention for spine. Now sputum with coag + staph and
   (likely contaminant) coag
 in blood culture.
   Shortness of breath/Hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Patient with known COPD at baseline on home oxygen. Trial of MMV on
   [**1-3**] resulted in no spontaneous breathing. Thererfore will check gas
   and if acceptable continue present pressure support for now, despite
   short apneic periods.  Will reduce FiO2 to 30%. Continue but reduce
   steroids for COPD, continue linezolid and cefepime given sputum
   culture. Also continue nebs. CXR stable to improved yesterday.
   Breathing stable to improved.  Little response per RT with nebs and
   fluid balance up by more than 8 liters over stay (here
 perhaps more
   including [**Location (un) 1415**]).  Given pseudomonas and MRSA in sputum
 have to
   cover for SA pneumonia and previous UTI (cefepime now covering)
   - Continue CMV
 reduce FiO2 to 30%
   - Diurese gently with goal of -500 mL to see if respiratory status
   improves further (continue steroids and antibiotics as are for now
   given changing fluid status today and desire to keep her in good shape
   for surgery)
   - Discuss ventilation/respiratory status with anesthesia to see if they
   feel that surgery possible tomorrow.
   - Solumedrol to 40 mg IV Q8H
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Continue cefepime, linezolid (vancomycin results in desquamative
   reaction) (for 8d course started on [**1-2**]).
   Unstable T11 fracture
   Ortho. Spine will be able to operate tomorrow.  We will continue to
   maximize respiratory status for surgery.  No MI despite PEA arrest, but
   originally not as clear and Anesthesia
s decision partly based on risk
   associated with recent MI.  Therefore she may not be very far from
   baseline risk at the present time given near baseline echo, no
   significant enzyme leak.  We will discuss ventilating her in prone
   position with recently dislocated shoulder with Anesthesia.
   - Continue to maximize respiratory status as above.
   - Talk to Anesthetics and Ortho Spine today
 also need to discuss with
   family for consent.
   Autonomic Lability and Hypotension
   Improved. Interesting
 unknown etiology.  DM, CMV, pain (some not
   transmitted to forebrain/at spinal level/brainstem), spinal injury,
   sepsis, UTI, PNA, other contributors.
   - Treat underlying causes, infection, pain
   - Continue fentanyl and versed (instead of Propofol)
 emphasize Versed
   over fentanyl given prominent anxiety when sedation is lowered and
   denial of pain
   - Keep off pressors now stable without
   Pain
   Denies when asked, but possible, so will cover.
   - Tylenol standing to synergize opioids (fentanyl for now)
   Sedation
   Possibly slightly too light this a.m. but subsequently in good place
   with adjustment to fentanyl 175 and Versed 2.
   - Continue with emphasis of Versed over fentanyl given prominent
   anxiety.
   PEA arrest
   Enzymes now trending down. Echo not remarkable.  Escaped serious
   myocardial damage. Typical CAD management.
   Shoulder Dislocation
   Reduced by Ortho.
   - Continue use of sling and monitor for dislocation and signs of pain
   Leukocytosis and Question of Sepsis
   Stable.  No other signs of sepsis.  No convincing positive blood
   cultures (one bottle coag-ve SA on arrival). Trending down now from
   18-19 now 11.
   Urinary Tract Infection
   Ciprofloxacin stopped based on cefepime coverage above (now day 8).
   Diabetes Mellitus
   Stable
 controlled on ISS (even with steroids).
   Anemia
   Stable to lower. Hematocrit 28 on arrival from 36 on [**2119-12-30**]. Now
   24.5. Likely dilutional.
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Trend hematocrit
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion goal > 21 or evidence of hypoxia

 INDICATION:  66-year-old female with AFib, wheezing, and crackles.  Evaluate
 for pneumonia.

 COMPARISON:  [**2160-3-10**].

 UPRIGHT AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is increased opacity at the bilateral lung
 bases, with small bilateral pleural effusions.  Most likely reflects pulmonary
 edema, though increased retrocardiac opacity makes it difficult to exclude a
 superimposed consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax.  The upper lung zones
 are clear.  Heart size is again enlarged, though unchanged from prior study.
 There is central pulmonary vascular congestion.  Surgical clips in the right
 upper quadrant from prior cholecystectomy.

 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities and small pleural effusions and central
 vascular congestion most compatible with cardiac decompensation in the setting
 of new arrhythmia.  It is difficult to exclude an evolving consolidation at
 the left lung base, and lateral radiographs would be helpful for further
 evaluation.

 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of a patient after left-side implantation of
 pacemaker through the left subclavian vein.

 Portable AP chest radiograph compared to previous study before the procedure
 obtained on the same-day at 08:45 p.m.

 The temporary pacemaker is removed in the meantime interval.  The left
 hemithorax pacemaker was inserted with two leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle with expected course and no signs of discontinuity.
 The Port-A-Cath catheter inserted through the right subclavian vein terminates
 at the cavoatrial junction.

 Bilateral perihilar opacities are consistent with pulmonary edema and grossly
 unchanged as well as bibasilar retrocardiac atelectasis.  Small bilateral
 pleural effusion is present.

 An external devise with a rectangular shape overlies the mid chest.  The chest
 radiograph has to be repeated without this artifact when the patient's
 condition allows.

   61 yo with complex pulmonary history including reactive airways disease
   in the setting of relapsing polychondritis and recent stent placement
   who presents with 7 day history of cough now with progressive dypspnea
   and new RLL infiltrate seen clearly on CXR with associated elevation in
   WBC count and bandemia.  Last pneumonvax was [**2171**] per records.
   Certainly community acquired bacterial pneumonia would appear to be
   clearly leading diagnosis which is provocative in the setting of recent
   negative bronch from [**5-19**] and stent placement [**2177-6-3**].  She now has a
   history and an exam consistent with central obstruction with likely
   secretions and will need to confirm stent placement.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**6-6**], the patient has taken a
 slightly better inspiration.  Continued bilateral pleural effusions with
 retrocardiac opacification consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe.
 The mediastinum is less wide and there is no evidence of azygos vein
 enlargement, consistent with some improved cardiac status.  A Dobbhoff tube is
 in place and extends to the stomach, where it passes the bottom of the image.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted electively to hospital, went to OR where under
general anesthesia underwent PLIF L3-4 and L4-5.  She tolerated
the procedure well, was extubated, transferred to PACU and then
floor. Diet and actvity were advanced.  Pain medication was
transitioned to PO. She had JP drain placed intra-op that was
monitored for output and removed on POD#2.  Foley was removed
and she was voiding though required straight cath once POD#2.
here I/Os were closely monitored.  Incision was clean dry and
intact with staples. Labs were followed and she recieved 1 unit
PRBC on POD#2 for hematocrit of 24. She was evaluated by PT/OT
and recommended for rehab.

On [**8-31**], foley was dicontinued and she voided once on her own.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:

 INDICATION:  Fevers and abdominal pain.  Patient s/p ileostomy takedown and
 lysis of adhesions.

 TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis performed after the IV
 administration of 150 cc of Optiray.  Nonionic contrast was used due to
 patient request.  Comparison is made to CT performed the previous day.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  There is interval worsening of pulmonary
 parenchymal consolidation within both lungs which is most prominent within the
 right lower lobe.  The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands,
 and kidneys are normal in appearance.  The patient is s/p colectomy with ileo-
 anal anastomosis.  A fluid collection within the anterior abdomen immediately
 deep to the rectus abdominis musculature is present with a thin enhancing rim
 and focus of extraluminal air along the inferior aspect of this fluid
 collection.  Compared to the prior examination there is decreased extraluminal
 gas.  The small bowel is diffusely dilated suggesting ileus.  There is no
 significant free fluid within the abdomen or pelvis.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Contrast is present within the patient's
 ileal pouch which is mildly distended.  No pathologically enlarged pelvic
 lymph nodes are seen.  Scattered prominent mesenteric lymph nodes are
 identified.  Bone windows show no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.

 IMPRESSION:
 1)  Worsening pneumonia which is most prominent within the right lower lobe.

 2)  Rim enhancing fluid collection with a single bubble of extraluminal air
 within the anterior abdomen immediately to the rectus abdominis musculature.

 3)  Distention of small bowel in this patient s/p ileostomy takedown
 suggestive of ileus.

 CT SCAN OF THE BRAIN [**2102-1-11**]

 INDICATION:  71-year-old male with craniotomy and acute subdural hematoma
 followup.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial noncontrast CT scans of the brain were obtained.

 Comparison is made to the previous study of [**2101-12-7**].

 FINDINGS:

 There is a residual subdural collection of greater density than CSF in the
 right superior frontal and parietal subdural space.  This is decreased in size
 since the previous study.  There has also been evolution of the right frontal
 lobe area of contusion, where encephalomalacia is now evident.  There is
 widening of the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 377**].  There is no shift of normally midline
 structures or hydrocephalus.  Left hemispheric structures appear unchanged.

 Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.

 IMPRESSION:  Decreased but persistent right subdural collection, with density
 that suggests blood products or proteinaceous material.
                                                                       DFDgf

 HISTORY:  Seizure after craniotomy.  Evaluate for interval development of
 hemorrhage.

 COMPARISON:  Head CT from [**2169-12-22**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT.

 HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There has been no significant interval change
 since the prior examination.  Again demonstrated is a mixed attenuation
 subdural hematoma along the right cerebral convexity with stable mass effect
 upon the adjacent right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes.  There still
 remains a large amount of pneumocephalus within the subdural collection, which
 also is unchanged since the prior study.  No new areas of intra or extraaxial
 hemorrhage are identified.  There is continued hypodensity within the
 subcortical white matter of the right frontal lobe, unchanged in the interval.
 Additionally, a stable hypodensity is also noted within the right cerebellar
 hemisphere.  There is no hydrocephalus.  There is stable mild leftward shift
 of midline structures, unchanged in the interval.

 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change in the appearance of the right
 subdural hemorrhage with pneumocephalus.  No new intracranial hemorrhage
 identified.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo male with history of AIDS and now presenting with persistent
   diarrhea and being ""found down"" by partner and then brought to [**Name (NI) **] for
   evaluation.  Following admission patient has had some improvement in
   diarrhea but has been complicated by persistent hypotension.
   1)Diarrhea
Certainly infectious causes have been considered and treated
   with minimal change.  The question of non-infectious diarrhea seems
   less likely but certainly is possible.
   -Will have to discuss with ID role of antibiotics and any refinement
   possible for empiric treatment.
   2)Hypotension
The source of this does appear to be possibly related to
   relative hypovolemia in the setting of diarrhea as evidenced by the
   persistence of tachycardia but patient does have relatively small
   volume of stools.  He has adrenal competence by measurments in serum.
   -Will check orthostatics today
   -Will recheck blood pressure in multiple sites
   -Would favor ECHO if hypotension persists despite stabilization of
   volume status

 INDICATION:  Left hip pain and altered mental status.

 COMPARISON:  CT colonography [**2108-12-14**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector helical scanning of abdomen and pelvis was performed
 without oral or intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformats were
 displayed.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  There is a moderate-sized nonhemorrhagic right pleural
 effusion and a tiny left pleural effusion.  A 6-mm pulmonary nodule at the
 left lung base is increased from 4 mm on [**2108-12-14**].  There is an
 additional 7 mm right lower lobe nodule (2:6) as well as several granulomas at
 the right lung base.  The heart is enlarged.  Evaluation of the abdomen is
 limited due to lack of IV contrast and streak artifact from the patient's
 arms.  The liver, spleen, gallbladder, pancreas and left adrenal gland are
 normal.  There is no hydronephrosis.  The  intra-abdominal small and large
 bowel loops are unremarkable with a large amount of stool throughout the
 colon.  The abdominal aorta is of normal caliber, with moderate
 atherosclerotic plaque.  There is no free fluid or free air and no significant
 lymphadenopathy.

 CT OF THE PELVIS:  Foley catheter and air are seen within the bladder.  The
 sigmoid colon and rectum are normal.

 There are no bone findings of malignancy.  There is partial sacralization of
 L5 with pseudarthrosis.  There is a low attenuation lesion within the proximal
 right femur which may represent a lipoma (300:30) or anuerysmal bone cyst. No
 femoral neck fracture is identified.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Extremely limited exam due to lack of IV contrast and artifact from the
 patient's arms.  No acute intra-abdominal process.

 2.  Moderate right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion.

 3.  7-mm right lower lobe and 6-mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodules.  A
 dedicated chest CT is recommended when the patient's acute issues and pleural
 effusion have resolved.

 at the inferior clavicular border.  Left-sided PICC line remains at the low
 SVC.  Gastric tube extends off the film.  Midline sternotomy wires are intact.
 A right-sided internal jugular sheath has been removed.

 IMPRESSION:  Portable film limited by low lung volumes.  No significant
 change.

 Pt spiking fevers, tachycardic, and hypotensive yesterday
   but without elevation in WBC. Has
 bottles blood Cx growing CoNS,
   sputum growing multiple GNRs, and stool C.diff positive. Did have
   concerning infiltrate on CXR concerning for VAP. Currently on Vanc,
   Zosyn, and Flagyl. Diff today with 81% PMNs. Now w/ 3 sputum cx all
   growing GNRs.
   - d/c Vanc (day 4),

   - con tFlagyl (day 4), PO Vanc (day 2) for C.diff
   - f/u all culture data
   - IVF boluses PRN hypotension, consider Levophed for pressor support
   # PEs - On admission pt w/ borderline BPs and considered not a surgical
   candidate. Progressively developed worsening tachycardia and hypoxia.
   Formal TTE and Cardiology consult --> TPA for lysis on [**5-17**] with
   improvement of HR and SaO2. Repeat TTE yesterday shows continued
   depressed RV function; however, right ventricular abnl is now better
   characterized as limpoma rather than clot. No evidence of bleeding.
   Also s/p IVC filter placement.
   - appreciate cardiology involvement, s/p lysis by TPA
   - continue heparin gtt, currently therapeutic, goal 80-100
   - cont to wean vent depending on sedation and secretions
   # Edema - Pt w/ increased edema as he has gotten several IVF boluses
   for his Hypotension. Lasix gtt w/ good effect on UOP, although pt still
   getting quite a bit of fluid in.
   - check for obligate Ins, consider changing some meds to PO rather than
   IV
   - cont Lasix gtt at current rate, increasing may be limited by
   hypotension
   # Hypotension - Developed post-lysis w/ TPA. Responsive to IVF.
   Initially thought to be [**2-15**] micro-emboli and expected to improve, but
   now more likely related to underlying infection and fevers. Transiently

 INDICATION:  75-year-old male patient with intracranial hemorrhage, to
 evaluate for interval change.

 This is a redictation of the report as the prior report was dictated as PFI
 and changes could not be made.

 COMPARISON:  Most recent CT head done on [**2176-11-24**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast CT head.

 FINDINGS:

 Again visualized are the two areas of subdural hemorrhage on the right side in
 frontal and parietal regions, with the right frontal focus of hemorrhage being
 slightly decreased compared to the prior study and now measuring 3 mm in
 transverse dimension.  The right parietal subdural hemorrhage is again
 minimally decreased and measures 3.5 mm in the transverse dimension without
 significant change.

 Small hyperdense focus noted in the quadrigeminal cistern on the right side is
 again slightly smaller.  No new areas of hemorrhage are noted.  There is no
 mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.  There is a vague
 hypodense area noted in the temporal lobes on both sides, likely related to
 artifacts.  Attention can be paid to this on close followup study.  Clinical
 correlation is also recommended.
 There is a left frontoparietal and temporal subgaleal hematoma noted, which is
 mildly decreased in size and seen to evolve.
 Mild prominence of the ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces is noted, likely
 related to mild volume loss.  There is moderate opacification in the sphenoid
 sinus and in the ethmoid air cells which is mildly increased compared to the
 prior study.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No significant change in the right-sided areas of subdural hemorrhage and
 a small subtle dense focus in the right quadrigeminal cistern.  No new areas
 of hemorrhage.  Details as above.
 2.  Questionable hypodense areas in the temporal lobes likely artifactual.
 Attention can be paid to these on followup study.

 within the vertebral body.  There is mild retropulsion of bony fragments
 posteriorly which result in at least moderate spinal canal narrowing.  There
 is posterior displacement of the thecal sac.  In addition, there is a small
 epidural hematoma, which extends inferiorly from L1 and courses posteriorly at
 the level of L2.  At the level of L2, there is no significant thecal sac
 compression.  The remaining vertebral bodies appear normal in alignment and
 shape.

 IMPRESSION:  L1 compression fracture with mild retropulsion of bone fragments
 posteriorly resulting in moderate spinal canal narrowing.  There is also an
 epidural hematoma, which travels inferiorly from this level and terminates
 posterior to L2.  There is no further spinal canal narrowing due to this
 epidural hematoma.

 ULTRASOUND SCAN OF RIGHT ARM

 CLINICAL DETAILS:  Right upper limb edema post-reduction internal fixation.
 Evaluation collection

 FINDINGS:

 Focused ultrasound over the area of swelling in the lateral right elbow region
 shows an ovoid heterogenous collection measuring up to 3.2 cm sagittal x 3.2
 cm transverse.  It is mainly anechoic (cystic) with some lattice-like internal
 echogenicity.  The appearance on ultrasound are most suggestive of a localized
 postoperative hematoma.  Infection cannot be excluded by imaging.

 CONCLUSION:


 1.  Small (3.2cm) collection in the right lateral elbow subcutaneous tissues.

FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage. There is no edema
or mass
effect. Differentiation of the grey and white matter is
preserved. The
ventricles are normal in configuration and size. The sulci are
prominent and

Brief Hospital Course:
46 yo F with known osteomyelitis of heel and pelvis and culture
positive for pseudomonas, recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] ICU on
[**2132-2-27**], presents from rehab with altered mental status and
hypotension consistent with sepsis. Family meeting was had to
address goals of care and the decision was made to make the
patient comfort measures only. She subsequently was started on a
morphine drip and passed on [**3-9**].
.
# Goals of Care: In discussion with the family, the decision was
made to make the patient comfort measures only. Life prolonging
medications were withdrawn and she was started on a morphine
gtt. She remained comfortable, without air hunger or agitation,
and passed on [**3-9**] around 11:10am.
.
#. Altered mental status:
Most likely delerium from sepsis given multiple potential ports
of entry with known osteo, extensive pressure ulcers, and
indwelling foley catheter. Head CT reassuring normal without
mass effect or hemorrhage. Urine toxicology only positive for
known opiate use. Is on multiple potential deleriogenic meds
that may be complicating picture.  Did not clear throughout stay
despite improvement in hemodynamics.  Had discussion with her
HCP and decided to pursue comfort measures only.
.
#. Hypotension:
Most consistent with sepsis given history of repeat
osteomyelitis and known current heel and pelvic osteo. Is at
high risk for ongoing or recurrent infection and sepsis. In
light of repeated use of vancomycin and carbapenems as well as
repeated visits to healthcare, must consider pathogens that are
missed by current Abx regimen such as VRE, VISA, cdiff, and
stenotrophomonas. Must also consider line sepsis given PICC
placed during last admission. CXR with possible retrocardiac
opacity, thought patient without history of pulmonary complaints
leading up to admission. Of note, patient's baseline blood
pressure appears to be in range of 80s to 90s systolic. ID knows
patient well and preliminarily recommended continuing patient on
her Vanc and carbapenem while awaiting culture results.  She
continued to have worsening blood pressures and amikacin and
linezolid were added for broader coverage.  In order to treat
the sepsis, we asked the surgical consultants for their advice.
Urology was consulted as her sacral wound likely eroded through
her urethra as the wound was draining urine.  They suggested
possible B NU tubes.  Gen [**Doctor First Name **] thought she would need a
colostomy, skin flaps and urethral reconstruction.  [**Doctor First Name 1957**]
recommended a BKA for her heel osteo.  These options were
presented to the family but they aggreed to comfort measures.
.
#. Schizophrenia, paranoid features:
Patient on olanzapine and lorazepam as outpatient, unknown if
currently having active delusions.  Held her PO meds while here.

.
#. Sacral decubitus ulcer:
Deep stage IV ulcer and known pelvic osetomyelitis.  Wound care
consulted, see above, was made comfort measures.
.
#. Heel ulcers:
Known underlying osetomyelitis.  Again wound care consulted,
[**Doctor First Name **] following, she would have need amputation for treatment.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  54-year-old status post hepatic resection for cholangiocarcinoma,
 with hepaticojejunostomy to the right biliary system.  Patient has 2 biliary
 catheters in place.  Please perform postoperative cholangiogram.

 RADIOLOGISTS: Procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 551**], the
 attending radiologist, present and supervising throughout.

 PROCEDURE & FINDINGS:  Patient was placed supine on the angiographic table and
 a pre-procedural time-out was performed.  Initial scout images demonstrate
 surgical staples.  The thin indwelling biliary catheters are difficult to
 visualize.  Contrast was slowly instilled via gravity drip first into the
 catheter that proved to be within the anterior branch of the right portal
 system.  There is normal opacification of the ducts in this distribution
 without evidence of leak.  There is some tightening at the anastomotic level
 likely due to postoperative edema.  Contrast was seen to opacify the small
 bowel distal to the anastomosis either from drainage or from more proximal
 sideholes.  Next, the catheter within the posterior division of the right
 biliary system was instilled via gravity drip and similarly demonstrated
 normal opacification of the ductal system in this distribution without
 evidence of extravasation.  There is again some narrowing near the anastomotic
 site, likely postoperative edema.  The catheter was gently flushed with normal
 saline and re-hooked to bag drainage.  Findings were discussed with the
 surgical resident at the time of the procedure.

 IMPRESSION:  Postoperative cholangiogram as above.  No evidence of biliary
 leak.  Slight narrowing at the anastomosis likely from expected postoperative
 edema.  Labels indicating anterior and posterior branches were placed on the
 catheters respectively as requested by the ordering team.

   Imaging: IMAGING:
   [**10-28**] ERCP: Sludge and small stone fragments were extracted. There is no
   evidence of biliary stricture or ductal dilatation. Filling defects
   within the gallbladder consistent with stones/sludge
   [**10-29**] CT: Basilar atelectasis and pleural effusion bilaterally.
   Moderate amount of fluid in peritoneal cavity, strandings in fat
   surrounding the pancreas and other organs and adynamic ileus are
   findings compatible with pancreatitis. No free air.
   [**10-31**] CXR: left-sided pleural effusion, basilar atelectasis
   [**11-2**] CXR: NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm, most likely
   terminating in the stomach. No interval change bibasilar atelectasis
   [**11-4**] CTA prelim: Interval worsening of peripancreatic inflammatory
   stranding without evidence yet of pancreatitis-related complication. No
   definite focal fluid collection observed. Anasarca with small left
   greater than right pleural effusions. Cholelithiasis with biliary stent
   in place.
   [**11-7**] CXR: Increasing left basilar atelectasis. Minimally improving
   right basilar atelectasis.
   [**11-13**] CXR: No interval change in ET tube is persistently low with tip
   1.7 cm above the carina. Bibasilar atelectasis with small pleural
   bilateral effusions are unchanged.
   [**11-14**] CXR: Endotracheal tube seen with tip approximately 3 cm above the
   carina. Nasogastric tube coursing over the stomach, tip incompletely
   imaged. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Persistent
   retrocardiac opacity and bilateral pleural effusions, not significantly
   changed from prior, however, do appear increasing since studies
   performed in [**2112-10-10**].
